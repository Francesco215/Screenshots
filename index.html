                <p>I never liked writing, but it’s important, so I have to practice.</p>
                <p>I gave myself some constraints:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each note has to fit in a screenshot from my phone</li>

            <div class="note-text">
                <p>The Earth is in the middle of two thermal reservoirs: The Sun and deep space.<br>
                    If two thermal reservoirs are available it becomes possible to extract energy.</p>
                <p>Once you have this energy you can use it in a multitude of ways</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Store it for later</li>
                    <li>Create more copies of yourself</li>
                    <li>Increase the amount of energy you can extract in the future</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can try to get more creative, but most of the other options are variations or combinations of the
                    ones
                    above</p>
                <p>Any heat engine that does any of the above is a life form</p>
                <p>Since the extractable energy is not infinite it is inevitable to enter a competition between the
                    various
                    life forms. That competition is evolution</p>

            <p class="note-title">The importance of Curiosity</p>
            <div class="note-text">
                <p>Every emotion has a function</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Love is for reproduction</li>
                    <li>Fear is for avoiding risks</li>
                    <li>Curiosity is for learning</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Like every other emotion, they exist because they are useful for survival, and as such they are just
                    emergent behaviours.</p>
                <p>I believe engineering emergent behaviours in AI is a waste of time, but curiosity is special—
                    Curiosity is
                    what makes us curate our own dataset.</p>
                <p>The whole field of dataset curation will be irrelevant once a good model for curiosity arises.</p>

                <p>You don’t control your reward circuitry. That’s by design</p>

                <p>This actually happened in real life:<br>
                    In the 80s doctors implanted an electrode in a patient’s brain capable of stimulating her
                    thalamus.<br>
                    The woman could control it with a device and the results where devastating</p>
                <p>Addictive drugs are like that button. That’s why they are bad</p>

                <p>It is supposed to be the most amazing world there can ever be.</p>
                <p>We humans design virtual worlds, and they are called video games. They don’t look at all like the
                    stereotypical type of world you associate with concept of paradise— That’s because jumping aimlessly
                    in the
                    clouds is boring</p>
                <p>We humans want challenges, and a perfect world doesn’t have any.<br>
                    Artificial super intelligence can turn our world into a paradise: pointless and boring</p>
                <p>Lately I’ve been playing less video games because the real world is more fun.</p>
                <p><br>…<br>Is our world actually a paradise in disguise?</p>

            <div class="note-text">
                <p>Every Minecraft player subconsciously knows what is the meaning of life</p>
                <p>In most games you are given a mission— that’s the meaning of your life inside of that video game</p>
                <p>But Minecraft is different, you are given a world and its laws of physics: its game mechanics. Sounds
                    familiar?</p>
                <p>Every game of Minecraft has no “real” meaning. Despite this, Minecraft is the most played video game
                    of all
                    time, and it’s no coincidence.</p>
                <p>Usually the developers take on the task of choosing the game’s mission. Notch *the creator of
                    Minecraft*
                    has delegated the role of choosing that to you.</p>
                <p>If the meaning of life is given externally, it’s just restriction— But if it comes from within you,
                    then
                    it’s freedom.</p>

                <p>In GTA you are a criminal and you earn money doing crimes— It’s very formative I must say.</p>
                <p>But being a criminal is no easy task, it’s a lot of work— Fortunately in GTA there are cheat codes
                </p>
                <p>When I first discovered that, It was amazing! I would fly around with helicopters and I wouldn’t even
                    need
                    to land them properly— If it crashes I can take a new one</p>
                <p>But within in a few days, what was once a fun game, became pointless and boring. Why even play if I
                    already
                    have everything?</p>
                <p>So I started a new campaign— I went back to being poor, and I fell in love with the game again.</p>
                <p>In real life it’s the same: I much prefer my life over the life of a billionaire’s son.<br>
                    That’s because I have an objective to strive for— It’s very formative I must say.</p>

            <div class="note-text">
                <p>Every word in the vocabulary is defined in terms of other words. Isn’t this strange?</p>
                <p>Some words indicate things in the real world, so that solves the paradox, but some words are
                    peculiar…</p>
                <p>Take the world “Existence”: It can only be defined in terms of itself (try it).</p>
                <p>This subtle fact explains why some questions are wierdly un-answerable:<br>
                    - Why do I exist?<br>
                    - What is existence?<br>
                    - Why does the universe exist?</p>
                <p>All of these questions can be translated into:</p>
                <p>Why does *this thing that exists* exist?</p>
                <p>And since the definition of existence is recursive the question is recursive and the answer is
                    recursive.
                    People that don’t understand recursion get stuck in an infinite loop.</p>

            <div class="note-text">
                <p>Thankfully the process through which scientific theories get established is fundamentally
                    un-democratic.
                    Is it possible to do the same with policies?</p>

                <p>With open source projects, if you are not happy with the governance, you can just fork it, however
                    you can’t fork a nation.</p>

                <p>This is because the most fundamental property of a nation is the monopoly on violence; if you split
                    it into two, you don’t have it anymore.</p>

                <p>We need to disentangle the monopoly on violence from policy.</p>

                <p>One way is having one federal government that only takes care of the army, and hundreds of
                    self-governing districts that take care of all the rest—laws included.</p>

                <p>If a district turns to shit, either they fix their course, or everyone is going to leave.
                    I must say that this model needs improvement, but it’s much better than just democracy.</p>

                <p>If an alien came to the earth and read the New Testament and the Quran, he would come to the
                    conclusion that the Muslim nations are nations of warriors, while the Christian nations would be
                    helpless.</p>

                <p>Turns out it's the other way around.</p>

                <p>The reason is tolerance: Most behaviors that deviate from the norm are just stupid, but sometimes
                    those strange ideas push the boundaries and lead to progress and prosperity.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, an intolerant society leads to stagnation.</p>

                <p>Our desires were perfectly aligned with our genes, but now it is no longer the case.</p>
                <p>Nowadays you can have sex without having kids&mdash; Even more importantly, kids used to be an asset
                    that would earn you money, now they are a drag.</p>
                <p>To be honest, I think it is a good thing: If we kept multiplying at the rate we had 100 years ago it
                    would have been a catastrophe.</p>
                <p>This period of un&mdash;alignment is precious and we need to use it well.</p>

            <div class="note-text">
                <p>Any sufficiently advanced life form will, at some point, invent money.</p>
                <p>This is because money is a crystallization of the internal reward model.</p>
                <p>Think about it: You use money to get things that you want&mdash; In some sense, you use money to get
                    things that “reward” you.</p>
                <p>Thanks to money it is possible to create the economy&mdash; An effective hivemind with a will of its
                    own.</p>
                <p>Current AIs are not able to exchange rewards.</p>
                <p>In my opinion it is the only missing piece to AGI.</p>
